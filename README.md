# lein-dependency-check

A Leiningen plugin for detecting vulnerable project dependencies. Basic clojure wrapper for [OWASP Dependency Check](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check).

## Configuration

### As a User-Level Plugin:

To run dependency-check without having to add it to every Leiningen project as a project-level plugin,
add dependency-check to the `:plugins` vector of your `:user` profile. E.g., a `~/.lein/profiles.clj` with dependency-check as a plugin -
```
{:user {:plugins [[com.livingsocial/lein-dependency-check "1.2.0"]]}}
```

If you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install lein-dependency-check 1.2.0`.

### As a Project-Level Plugin:

Add `[com.livingsocial/lein-dependency-check "1.2.0"]` to the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Project-level configuration may be provided under a `:dependency-check` key in your project.clj. Currently supported options are:
 * `log` log each vulnerability found to stdout
 * `throw` throw an exception after analysis and reporting if vulnerabilities are found, eg. to fail a build
 * `min-cvss-v3` minimum [CVSSv3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) score required to `:throw` (number from 0.0 to 10.0), defaults to 0.0
 * `properties-file` Specifies a file that contains properties to merge with default values
 * `output-format` Vector of desired output formats: xml, csv, json, html, vuln, all
 * `output-directory` Directory to output results to
 * `suppression-file` Path to the suppression XML file

## Usage

To generate a `dependency-check-report.html` report file to the current project's `target` directory, run:

    $ lein dependency-check

To generate the report in XML format, run:

    $ lein dependency-check --output-format :xml

To generate the report in multiple formats, run:

    $ lein dependency-check --output-format :xml,:json,:html,:csv

To write the report to a different directory (e.g., `/tmp`), run:

    $ lein dependency-check --output-directory /tmp

To set logging to stdout:

    $ lein dependency-check --log

To set throw error when vulnerabilities found:

    $ lein dependency-check --throw
    
To only throw if there are vulnerabilities with or above a given CVSSv3:

    $ lein dependency-check --throw --min-cvss-v3 5

To set a suppression file:

    $ lein dependency-check --suppression-file /suppression.xml

To set a properties file:

    $ lein dependency-check --properties-file /dependencycheck.properties

##  Suppressing False Positives

Support for suppressing false positives can be utilized by creating `suppression.xml` in your project's root directory.

Suppression snippets can be copied from the HTML report file directly into `suppression.xml`. Upon rerun of `lein-dependency-check`, the suppression file will be used and warnings will not be present in report.
